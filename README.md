### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About me

🙋‍♂️ I am João Pedro dos Santos, a Data Scientist, currently working at a company in Brazil. 

📖 I've been studying AI topics since middle of 2021, focusing more on TensorFlow, Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. 

🎮 In my free time I do really like to play games like League Of Legends and Fifa, hang out with friends and watch a few series as Brooklyn 99, Friends, The Witcher and romance movies.
